Color blindness (or color vision deficiency) is the decreased ability to see color or differences in color.
A genetic deficiency, color blindness is incurable and can make some activities difficult as well as prohibit certain professions such as that of a pilot, train driver, or armed forces.
Affecting about 8% of males and 0.5% of females, the science behind color blindness is well known.
There are three types: Protanopia, Deuteranopia, and Tritanopia, with deuteranopia being the most common.

Apple recently introduced ARKit with iOS 11. ARKit is "a new framework that allows you to easily create unparalleled augmented reality experiences for iPhone and iPad" that works by allowing applications to blend "digital objects and information with the environment... freeing them to interact with the real world in entirely new ways."
By affecting how someone sees and experiences the world, Apple's ARKit enables developers to create augmented reality experiences that drastically change how a user interacts with the color of the objects around him,
opening the door to new and unique transformations to the experience of color blind people.
